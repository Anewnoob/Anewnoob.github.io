# Basic information
I received the B.S. degree in software engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2018, and also received the M.S. degree in UESTC in 2021 . My current research interests include neural ODEs, spatio-temporal data mining, urban flow super resolution, and time series analysis.
Now, i'm working for Bytedance and as an algorithm engineer in the visual computing group. If you want to join us, please contact me through the following waysï¼š
